 Random Quote Generator

 ## Description

The Random Quote Generator reads through a series of quotes and chooses one at
random to display to the browser. Each time a new quote is displayed, the
background color of the screen also changes. Quotes are changed every 10 seconds
unless the viewer clicks a button to display another quote.
